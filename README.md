# Madeline's Scheduling App: Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This is a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each working hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML & CSS powered by jQuery. It uses the Day.js library to provide udpated date & time, which helps to show the user their current & upcoming events using colour-coordinated time blocks based on whether the time is in the past, present or future.

## Installation

## Usage
The user can type their daily tasks and/or reminders into the corresponding hour's textbox. Without refreshing the page, the user can write their schedule and move things around to see what their day will look like. In order for the inputted data to be saved, the corresponding hour's save button must be clicked. This information is stored locally on the user's browser to ensure that if the user exits or refreshes the page, the information won't disappear. If the user changes their mind and wants to change a task/reminder, they can delete what has been written and click the save button again.

Application functionality can be seen in the screen recording below:
